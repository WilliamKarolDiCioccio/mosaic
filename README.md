# 🎮 Mosaic Game Engine

Welcome to the **Mosaic Game Engine** — a modern, lightweight, cross-platform game engine built with ❤️ and **C++20**.

This is my second journey into building a game engine from scratch, and the goal is simple: **learn deeply**, **build something beautiful**, and **invite others to create with me**.

---

## ✨ Project Highlights

- 🔧 **Modern C++20** codebase
- 🌍 **Cross-platform support**: Windows, Linux, and Web
- 🚀 **High-performance rendering**: Vulkan for native platforms, WebGPU for the web
- 🧱 Modular architecture:
  - Engine runtime (DLL)
  - Editor
  - Testbed
  - Unit and integration tests

---

## 📦 Build System & Dependencies

We use:

- **CMake** for build configuration
- **VCPKG** for cross-platform package management
- External dependencies not available on VCPKG are added as Git submodules under the `vendor/` directory

---

## 🧪 Testing

Robust testing using **Google Test (GTest)**:

- ✅ Unit tests for math, serialization, and core utilities
- 🔗 Integration tests for systems like the render pipeline and asset importers

---

## 📚 Coding Style

To maintain consistency and code quality, we follow our own style conventions based on the Google C++ Style Guide.

👉 [See our Coding Style Guide](./CONVENTIONS.md)

Please read this before contributing! Clean code helps everyone 😄
