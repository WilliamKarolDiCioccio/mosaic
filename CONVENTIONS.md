# Coding Style and Naming Conventions

## Overview

This document outlines the coding style and naming conventions adopted in this project. The guidelines are primarily based on the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html), with specific adaptations to suit our development practices. Adhering to these conventions ensures code consistency, readability, and maintainability across the codebase.

## Code Formatting

We use **Clang Format** as the standard tool for code formatting. For specific formatting rules, refer to the configuration files:

- [.clang-format](./.clang-format)
- [.clang-tidy](./.clang-tidy)

We recommend using the **Clang Power Tools** extension if working in Visual Studio to ensure compliance with formatting standards.

## Integration with External Code

When incorporating third-party libraries, a balance must be maintained between adhering to internal coding standards and accommodating external APIs. Through layered abstraction, we isolate inconsistencies and maintain overall coherence in our codebase.

## Build System

Our build system is based on **CMake**, chosen for its flexibility, scalability, and wide support across platforms and IDEs. We use **VCPKG** as our cross-platform package manager to manage external dependencies. When a dependency is not available through VCPKG, it is added to the project as a Git submodule under the `vendor` directory located at the root of the repository. This ensures that all required libraries are version-controlled and easily accessible during the build process.

## Testing

We use **Google Test (GTest)** to implement both unit tests and integration tests. Testing is a critical part of the development lifecycle and helps us ensure the stability and correctness of the engine.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are written for isolated components with well-defined inputs and outputs. Examples of what should be tested:

- **Math utilities**: Vector and matrix operations, quaternion conversions, interpolation functions.
- **Core engine systems**: Resource loading logic, scene graph hierarchy traversal, time step calculations.
- **Serialization**: Config file parsers, custom binary formats.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests cover interactions between components to ensure systems work together correctly. Examples include:

- Asset pipeline end-to-end conversion and import tests.
- Render pipeline setup and teardown for different hardware backends.
- ECS system behavior during entity/component creation and destruction.

### What Not to Test

Avoid testing:

- **Rendering output pixels**: These are often hardware- and driver-dependent and prone to false positives.
- **Third-party code**: Assume third-party libraries are well-tested and focus only on your integration logic.
- **Non-deterministic systems**: Avoid trying to test systems that rely on user input, random number generators, or real-time clocks unless the randomness is seeded and predictable.

A well-structured testing suite saves time during regression and improves confidence in changes across subsystems., chosen for its flexibility, scalability, and wide support across platforms and IDEs. We use **VCPKG** as our cross-platform package manager to manage external dependencies. When a dependency is not available through VCPKG, it is added to the project as a Git submodule under the `vendor` directory located at the root of the repository. This ensures that all required libraries are version-controlled and easily accessible during the build process.

## Class Structure

When defining classes with a large number of fields and methods, separate related sections using comments for improved readability.

```cpp
class ExampleClass {
 public:
  // Constructors and destructors
  ExampleClass();
  ~ExampleClass();

  // Public methods
  void initialize();
  void update();

 private:
  // Member variables
  int m_counter;
  float m_speed;
};
```

## Naming Conventions

### Functions

- Function names use **camelCase**.
- Function parameters use **camelCase** with an **underscore prefix (`_`)** to distinguish them from local variables.

```cpp
void processData(int _inputData);
```

### Class Fields

- Instance fields: **camelCase** with an **`m_` prefix**.
- Static fields: **camelCase** with an **`s_` prefix**.

```cpp
class MyClass {
 private:
  int m_id;
  static int s_instanceCount;
};
```

### Global Variables

- Use **camelCase** with a **`g_` prefix**.

```cpp
int g_applicationState;
```

### Class Names

- Use **PascalCase** without prefixes.

```cpp
class NetworkManager {};
```

### File Names

- Use **snake_case** to describe the fileâ€™s primary content, typically matching the main class name.

```bash
network_manager.cpp
```

### Macros and Constants

- Macros: Use **ALL_CAPS** with underscores. Restrict macro usage to source files to avoid polluting the global namespace.
- Constants: Use **camelCase** with a **`c_` prefix** to denote compile-time constants.

```cpp
#define MAX_BUFFER_SIZE 1024
const int c_defaultTimeout = 30;
```

### Enums

- Enum values use **camelCase** with underscores for readability and to avoid clashes with macros.

```cpp
enum class RenderMode {
  wireframe,
  shaded,
  textured,
};
```

## Documentation Conventions

We use **Doxygen** as the standard documentation generator for the engine. All documentation should strive to be **clear, concise, and helpful to both new and experienced contributors**.

### What to Document

- **All non-trivial public and internal APIs** must be documented.
- Any function or class that has:

  - **Side effects**
  - **Performance implications**
  - **Complex input/output behavior**

- Document **subsystems**, **core abstractions**, and **data flow** at a high level when relevant.
- Avoid redundant comments on trivial functions (e.g., `size()` on containers).

### Where to Document

- Use **Doxygen-style comments** directly in headers for functions, classes, and enums.
- For **complex implementation logic**, use in-source comments in `.cpp` files to explain:

  - Non-obvious control flow
  - Performance-critical code
  - Subtle algorithmic behavior

### Style and Format

- Use **full sentences** with correct punctuation.
- Start function descriptions with a verb in **third-person singular** ("Returns", "Initializes", "Calculates").
- Mention:

  - Preconditions and postconditions
  - Ownership and lifetime expectations
  - Thread safety or concurrency constraints
  - Units of measurement (e.g., milliseconds, degrees, normalized)

```cpp
/**
 * Initializes the graphics subsystem and prepares rendering backends.
 *
 * Must be called before any rendering calls. This function allocates GPU memory and
 * sets up hardware-specific pipelines.
 *
 * @return True if initialization succeeded, false otherwise.
 */
bool Rendered::init();
```

### File Organization

- If an entire file or subsystem needs explanation, place a Doxygen `\file` or `\brief` comment block at the top.
- Document major modules in standalone `.md` files under the `docs/` directory for higher-level guides.

By following these conventions, we promote a unified and professional development experience. These guidelines aim to simplify onboarding, facilitate collaboration, and ensure long-term maintainability.

**Good Development,**
