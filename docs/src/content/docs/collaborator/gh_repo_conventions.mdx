title: GitHub Repository Conventions
description: Standards and workflows for contributing to Mosaic on GitHub.
---

Building a sustainable engine isn’t just about how we write code—it’s also about **how we collaborate around that code**. Issues, branches, commits, pull requests, and automation form the connective tissue of the project. If those are messy, the codebase will eventually follow.

These conventions define how we use GitHub in Mosaic. They exist to keep collaboration predictable, reduce cognitive overhead, and make it easier for both newcomers and long-term contributors to work effectively without stepping on each other’s toes.

As with our C++ conventions, these rules are not theoretical. They’re shaped by real friction points we want to avoid as the project grows.

## The Philosophy Behind Our Workflow

GitHub is not just a hosting platform—it’s a **shared communication layer**. Every commit message, branch name, label, and PR description is part of how contributors understand intent, scope, and impact.

Our guiding principles are:

- **Clarity over cleverness**
- **Consistency over personal preference**
- **Automation where it removes human error**
- **Low barrier to entry for new contributors**

If something can be inferred automatically, we structure our workflow so tools can infer it. If something needs human judgment, we make that judgment explicit and visible.

---

## Commits and Branches: Structured Intent

We follow two complementary standards:

- **Conventional Commits**  
  https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary
- **Conventional Branch Names**  
  https://conventional-branch.github.io/

### Why This Matters

Structured commits and branches allow us to:
- Understand *what changed* and *why* without reading diffs
- Generate changelogs automatically
- Reason about breaking changes
- Keep history readable months or years later

### Commit Messages

Every commit message must follow the Conventional Commits format:

```

type(scope): short description

```

Examples:
```

feat(renderer): add bindless texture support
fix(ecs): prevent dangling entity handles
docs(engine): clarify renderer initialization order

```

Breaking changes **must** be explicitly marked according to the specification.

### Branch Names

Branches follow the same intent-driven structure:

```

type/scope/short-description

```

Examples:
```

feat/graphics/shadow-mapping
fix/core/thread-race
docs/architecture/ecs-overview

```

This makes it immediately obvious what a branch is about *before* opening a PR.

## Issues and Labels: A Shared Vocabulary

Labels are the backbone of how we reason about work in Mosaic. They encode **what something is**, **where it belongs**, **its urgency**, **its state**, and **its scope**—all at a glance.

We deliberately use a **rich but structured label taxonomy**. This avoids overloading single labels with too much meaning and allows automation, filtering, and triage to scale as the project grows.

---

### 📦 Packages

Package labels identify **which deliverable or artifact** is affected. These are especially important because Mosaic is a multi-package repository.

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "8px"}}>
  {[
    "Codex",
    "docsgen",
    "metagen",
    "Editor",
    "Testbed",
    "Mosaic Engine",
  ].map(p => (
    <span style={{background:"#D8D1FB",color:"black",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>
      {`Package: ${p}`}
    </span>
  ))}
</div>

Use **exactly one** package label whenever possible. If an issue truly spans multiple packages, that should be explicitly justified in the description.

---

### 🧱 Departments (Subsystem Ownership)

Department labels indicate **which technical area owns the work**. They are used for routing, review assignment, and long-term accountability.

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "8px"}}>
  {[
    "CI/CD",
    "Core Systems",
    "Documentation",
    "ECS",
    "Graphics",
    "Testing",
    "Tooling",
    "Translations",
    "Dependencies",
  ].map(d => (
    <span style={{background:"#0075CA",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>
      {`Department: ${d}`}
    </span>
  ))}
</div>

Department labels answer the question:
**“Who should care about this?”**

---

### 🖥 Platforms

Platform labels specify **where the issue manifests or applies**. They are critical for cross-platform correctness and regression tracking.

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "8px"}}>
  {["Android","Linux","Web","Windows"].map(p => (
    <span style={{background:"#ddb6e5",color:"black",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>
      {`Platform: ${p}`}
    </span>
  ))}
</div>

If a problem is platform-agnostic, no platform label is required.

---

### 🚦 Priority

Priority expresses **urgency and impact**, not personal interest or convenience.

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "8px"}}>
  <span style={{background:"#FF0000",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Priority: Critical</span>
  <span style={{background:"#FF6500",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Priority: High</span>
  <span style={{background:"#FFBF00",color:"black",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Priority: Medium</span>
  <span style={{background:"#099A50",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Priority: Low</span>
</div>

Priority should be assigned during triage, not guessed by default.

---

### 📌 Status (Lifecycle Tracking)

Status labels describe **where an issue or PR is in its lifecycle**. Only one status label should be active at a time.

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "8px"}}>
  <span style={{background:"#050505",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: Abandoned</span>
  <span style={{background:"#099A50",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: Accepted</span>
  <span style={{background:"#80FFA3",color:"black",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: Available</span>
  <span style={{background:"#FF0000",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: Blocked</span>
  <span style={{background:"#009B97",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: Completed</span>
  <span style={{background:"#D5D5D5",color:"black",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: In Progress</span>
  <span style={{background:"#FF0000",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: On Hold</span>
  <span style={{background:"#FFFB80",color:"black",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: Pending</span>
  <span style={{background:"#000000",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: Refused</span>
  <span style={{background:"#FFBF00",color:"black",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: Review Needed</span>
  <span style={{background:"#FF0000",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: Revision Needed</span>
  <span style={{background:"#6B1375",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: Triaged</span>
</div>

Status labels answer:
**“What is happening with this right now?”**

---

### 🧭 Type (Intent of the Work)

Type labels classify **what kind of work** an issue or PR represents.

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "8px"}}>
  <span style={{background:"#FF0000",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Type: Bug</span>
  <span style={{background:"#4B26C9",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Type: Development</span>
  <span style={{background:"#A2EEEF",color:"black",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Type: Enhancement</span>
  <span style={{background:"#33CB51",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Type: Feature</span>
  <span style={{background:"#FFBF00",color:"black",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Type: Maintenance</span>
  <span style={{background:"#D876E3",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Type: Question</span>
</div>

Type labels answer:
**“What kind of change is this?”**

---

### 🌱 Contribution-Friendly Defaults

These labels have **special meaning on GitHub** and are intentionally preserved.

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "8px"}}>
  <span style={{background:"#7057ff",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>good first issue</span>
  <span style={{background:"#006B75",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>help wanted</span>
</div>

* **good first issue** — Curated for newcomers, with clear scope and guidance
* **help wanted** — Maintainers actively welcome external contributions

---

### 🤖 Automation & Dependabot

The following labels are **used automatically** by Dependabot and related tooling:

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "8px"}}>
  <span style={{background:"#000000",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>github_actions</span>
  <span style={{background:"#000000",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>dart</span>
</div>

Do not remove or repurpose these labels—they are part of the automation pipeline.

---

### Labeling Philosophy (Important)

Not every issue needs every label.

**Typical minimum set:**

* 1 × `Type`
* 1 × `Status`
* 1 × `Package`
* Optional: `Department`, `Platform`, `Priority`

Labels are not decoration—they are **structured metadata**. When used consistently, they make large-scale maintenance and triage possible without meetings or spreadsheets.

---

## Issue and Pull Request Templates

We **strongly recommend** using the provided **issue and pull request templates**, especially if you’re new to the project.

Templates exist to:
- Ask the right questions up front
- Reduce back-and-forth clarification
- Make issues actionable
- Keep reviews focused on substance, not missing context

If you’re experienced, templates still save time. If you’re new, they act as guardrails.

---

## Automation and Dependency Management

### Dependabot

Mosaic uses **Dependabot** to keep dependencies up to date for:

- **VCPKG** (C++ dependencies)
- **pub.dev** (Dart / Flutter tooling)

Automated PRs are labeled appropriately and should be reviewed like any other change. We don’t blindly merge dependency updates—**we verify integration and impact**.

---

### Claude Code Integration

The repository includes a **Claude Code integration** to assist with:
- Code exploration
- Refactoring assistance
- Understanding unfamiliar subsystems

This tool is intended to **augment contributor productivity**, not replace engineering judgment. Generated suggestions must be reviewed with the same care as human-written code.

---

## The Long View

A GitHub repository is a living system. The more contributors it attracts, the more important structure becomes. These conventions ensure that Mosaic remains:

- Approachable for newcomers
- Predictable for maintainers
- Scalable as complexity increases

The goal isn’t bureaucracy—it’s **reducing friction so energy goes into building the engine, not managing chaos**.

As the project evolves, these conventions may evolve too. When they do, they will change for the same reason they exist now: to make collaboration smoother, clearer, and more sustainable.
