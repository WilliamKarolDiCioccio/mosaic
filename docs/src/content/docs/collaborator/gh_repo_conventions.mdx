title: GitHub Repository Conventions
description: Standards and workflows for contributing to Mosaic on GitHub.
---

Building a sustainable engine isn’t just about how we write code—it’s also about **how we collaborate around that code**. Issues, branches, commits, pull requests, and automation form the connective tissue of the project. If those are messy, the codebase will eventually follow.

These conventions define how we use GitHub in Mosaic. They exist to keep collaboration predictable, reduce cognitive overhead, and make it easier for both newcomers and long-term contributors to work effectively without stepping on each other’s toes.

As with our C++ conventions, these rules are not theoretical. They’re shaped by real friction points we want to avoid as the project grows.

## The Philosophy Behind Our Workflow

GitHub is not just a hosting platform—it’s a **shared communication layer**. Every commit message, branch name, label, and PR description is part of how contributors understand intent, scope, and impact.

Our guiding principles are:

- **Clarity over cleverness**
- **Consistency over personal preference**
- **Automation where it removes human error**
- **Low barrier to entry for new contributors**

If something can be inferred automatically, we structure our workflow so tools can infer it. If something needs human judgment, we make that judgment explicit and visible.

## Commits and Branches: Structured Intent

We follow two complementary standards:

- **Conventional Commits**  
  https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary
- **Conventional Branch Names**  
  https://conventional-branch.github.io/

### Why This Matters

Structured commits and branches allow us to:
- Understand *what changed* and *why* without reading diffs
- Generate changelogs automatically
- Reason about breaking changes
- Keep history readable months or years later

### Commit Messages

Every commit message must follow the Conventional Commits format:

```

type(scope): short description

```

Examples:
```

feat(renderer): add bindless texture support
fix(ecs): prevent dangling entity handles
docs(engine): clarify renderer initialization order

```

Breaking changes **must** be explicitly marked according to the specification.

### Branch Names

Branches follow the same intent-driven structure:

```

type/scope/short-description

```

Examples:
```

feat/graphics/shadow-mapping
fix/core/thread-race
docs/architecture/ecs-overview

```

This makes it immediately obvious what a branch is about *before* opening a PR.

## Issues and Labels: Making State Explicit

Labels are how we encode meaning at scale. They communicate **ownership**, **priority**, **status**, **platform impact**, and **intent** without requiring long explanations.

Below is the canonical label set used in Mosaic.

### Visual Legend

Each label is shown with its actual GitHub color for easy recognition.

---

### 🔧 Technical Scope

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "8px"}}>
  <span style={{background:"#000000",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>dart</span>
  <span style={{background:"#000000",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>github_actions</span>
  <span style={{background:"#0366d6",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>dependencies</span>
</div>

- **dart** — Pull requests that update Dart code
- **github_actions** — Changes to GitHub Actions workflows
- **dependencies** — Dependency updates (manual or automated)

---

### 🧱 Departments (Ownership & Responsibility)

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "8px"}}>
  {[
    "CI/CD",
    "Core Systems",
    "Documentation",
    "ECS",
    "Graphics",
    "Testing",
    "Tooling",
  ].map(label => (
    <span style={{background:"#0075CA",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>
      {`Department: ${label}`}
    </span>
  ))}
</div>

Department labels identify **which subsystem or team area** is affected.  
They help route issues, reviews, and long-term ownership.

---

### 📚 Documentation & Meta

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "8px"}}>
  <span style={{background:"#0075ca",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>documentation</span>
  <span style={{background:"#cfd3d7",color:"black",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>duplicate</span>
  <span style={{background:"#e4e669",color:"black",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>invalid</span>
  <span style={{background:"#d876e3",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>question</span>
</div>

- **documentation** — Improvements or additions to docs
- **duplicate** — Already reported elsewhere
- **invalid** — Not a valid issue (outdated, incorrect, or off-scope)
- **question** — Further clarification is needed

---

### ✨ Features & Contribution Entry Points

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "8px"}}>
  <span style={{background:"#a2eeef",color:"black",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>enhancement</span>
  <span style={{background:"#7057ff",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>good first issue</span>
  <span style={{background:"#006B75",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>help wanted</span>
</div>

- **enhancement** — New features or improvements
- **good first issue** — Specifically curated for newcomers
- **help wanted** — Maintainers want external help here

---

### 🖥 Platform Targets

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "8px"}}>
  {["Android","Linux","Web","Windows"].map(p => (
    <span style={{background:"#ddb6e5",color:"black",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>
      {`Platform: ${p}`}
    </span>
  ))}
</div>

Platform labels indicate where an issue or PR is relevant or affected.

---

### 🚦 Priority

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "8px"}}>
  <span style={{background:"#FF0000",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Priority: Critical</span>
  <span style={{background:"#FF6500",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Priority: High</span>
  <span style={{background:"#FFBF00",color:"black",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Priority: Medium</span>
  <span style={{background:"#099A50",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Priority: Low</span>
</div>

Priority reflects **impact and urgency**, not personal interest.

---

### 📌 Status Tracking

<div style={{display: "flex", flexWrap: "wrap", gap: "8px"}}>
  <span style={{background:"#050505",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: Abandoned</span>
  <span style={{background:"#099A50",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: Accepted</span>
  <span style={{background:"#80FFA3",color:"black",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: Available</span>
  <span style={{background:"#FF0000",color:"white",padding:"4px 8px",borderRadius:"6px"}}>Status: Blocked</span>
</div>

Status labels describe **lifecycle state**, not priority.

---

## Issue and Pull Request Templates

We **strongly recommend** using the provided **issue and pull request templates**, especially if you’re new to the project.

Templates exist to:
- Ask the right questions up front
- Reduce back-and-forth clarification
- Make issues actionable
- Keep reviews focused on substance, not missing context

If you’re experienced, templates still save time. If you’re new, they act as guardrails.

---

## Automation and Dependency Management

### Dependabot

Mosaic uses **Dependabot** to keep dependencies up to date for:

- **VCPKG** (C++ dependencies)
- **pub.dev** (Dart / Flutter tooling)

Automated PRs are labeled appropriately and should be reviewed like any other change. We don’t blindly merge dependency updates—**we verify integration and impact**.

---

### Claude Code Integration

The repository includes a **Claude Code integration** to assist with:
- Code exploration
- Refactoring assistance
- Understanding unfamiliar subsystems

This tool is intended to **augment contributor productivity**, not replace engineering judgment. Generated suggestions must be reviewed with the same care as human-written code.

---

## The Long View

A GitHub repository is a living system. The more contributors it attracts, the more important structure becomes. These conventions ensure that Mosaic remains:

- Approachable for newcomers
- Predictable for maintainers
- Scalable as complexity increases

The goal isn’t bureaucracy—it’s **reducing friction so energy goes into building the engine, not managing chaos**.

As the project evolves, these conventions may evolve too. When they do, they will change for the same reason they exist now: to make collaboration smoother, clearer, and more sustainable.
