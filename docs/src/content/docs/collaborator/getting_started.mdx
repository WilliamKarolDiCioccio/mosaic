Mosaic uses CMake as its build system. Most dependencies are managed via vcpkg, while those unavailable through vcpkg — such as WebGPU, utility libraries, or components requiring special build profiles — are included as submodules under the vendor/ directory.

On Windows, we recommend using Visual Studio 2022 over VS Code for better CMake integration. The default compiler on Windows is MSVC, but Clang is also supported — and is the preferred compiler on Linux and Web targets (via Emscripten).

## Environment Setup

:::tip{icon="star"}
Before building Mosaic, you'll need to set up a few tools and SDKs. The engine targets **Windows**, **Linux**, **Web** and **Android** but you can ignore requirements for the build configurations you're not interested in.
:::

:::caution
Development for the Web is currently **on hold** due to ongoing instability in the WebGPU API. The API is still under heavy development and changes frequently, which makes maintaining a stable web build impractical at this time. Web support will resume once the WebGPU specification and tooling become more stable.
:::

:::note
Development for Android is currently **on hold** Due to significant technical challenges with Android's GameTextInput and IME (soft keyboard) implementation.
:::

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.25 or later
- Git — with submodule support
- Python 3 — required for Emscripten and some build scripts
- A **C++23-compliant compiler** (MSVC ≥ 17.13 Preview 2, Clang ≥ 13, or GCC ≥ 14)

### Install vcpkg

We use **vcpkg in manifest mode** to manage most dependencies.

<Steps>

1. Clone vcpkg:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
   ./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh  # or .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat on Windows
   ```

2. If needed, set the environment variable `VCPKG_ROOT` to point to your vcpkg directory.

</Steps>

:::tip
No need to integrate VCPKG globally — Mosaic uses the local `vcpkg.json` manifest.
:::

### Setup for Web (Emscripten/WebGPU)

<Steps>

1. Install the **Emscripten SDK**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
   cd emsdk
   ./emsdk install latest
   ./emsdk activate latest
   source ./emsdk_env.sh  # or emsdk_env.bat on Windows
   ```

2. Ensure `emcc` is in your `PATH` before running CMake.

3. Confirm that `-pthread`, `-matomics`, and `-mbulk-memory` flags are supported — see build notes below if WebGPU issues arise.

</Steps>

:::tip{icon="rocket"}
We suggest debugging Emscripten builds directly inside the browser either using the built-in dev-tools or installing the WASM debugging plugin available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cc++-devtools-support-dwa/pdcpmagijalfljmkmjngeonclgbbannb). The project is automatically configured to generate teh relevant debug information.
:::

### Setup for Windows (Visual Studio 2022)

- Install **Visual Studio 2022** with the following components:

  - "Desktop development with C++"
  - "C++ CMake tools for Windows"
  - "MSVC v143" or later
  - "Windows 10 or 11 SDK"

### Setup for Linux

- Install **required packages**:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install build-essential cmake git ninja-build python3 python3-pip libx11-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libvulkan-dev
  ```

### Setup for Android <Badge text="Experimental" variant="danger" />

<Steps>

1. Install **Android Studio**.

2. Inside the SDK Manager, install:

   - Android NDK (r23 or newer)
   - CMake and LLDB
   - SDK tools for API level 24+ (Vulkan support)

3. Set the environment variable `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` to point to your NDK installation.
   
</Steps>

## Build Instructions

<Steps>

1. Clone the repository and initialize submodules. `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/WilliamKarolDiCioccio/mosaic`.

2. Select a CMake configure preset, then a build preset (the vcpkg toolchain manages installation automatically).

3. Build the project — and you're good to go!

</Steps>

:::caution
When building for the Web, you might encounter issues related to threading support.

Mosaic uses the -pthread flag in Emscripten to enable Web Workers, which helps retain compatibility with native threading code. Occasionally, you may need to manually patch the build system to support this.

If the build fails with missing atomic features, add the following flag manually in the `emdawnwebgpu.port.py` file located at:

`out/build/emscripten-${PROFILE}/\_deps/emdawnwebgpu-src/`

Update the flags section as follows:

```diff lang="py"
flags = ['-g', '-std=c++17', '-fno-exceptions']
+flags += ['-matomics', '-mbulk-memory'] # <-- Add this line
flags += compute_library_compile_flags(settings)
```

:::

This ensures compatibility with multi-threaded WebAssembly targets.
