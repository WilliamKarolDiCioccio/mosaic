description: The why, how, and what of Mosaic.
---

Mosaic is a modern, cross-platform game engine written in C++23, built from the ground up as both a learning journey and a foundation for something greater.

Like all of my projects, Mosaic is first and foremost an exploration: a deep dive into systems programming, computer graphics, and game architecture. But it's not a toy. The engine is designed with the long-term goal of becoming a stable, professional-grade platform for interactive experiences — games, simulations, creative tools, and beyond.

Unlike many hobby engines that wrap existing libraries, Mosaic takes a bottom-up approach. I'm building its core systems from scratch — from a cache-friendly Entity-Component-System (ECS) and layered input system, to a Vulkan/WebGPU-based renderer, an async-aware I/O layer, and eventually a full editor and asset pipeline. It's about understanding, not just using.

:::caution
Currently this is still a single developer project, therefore time must be split between building the engine, learning new concepts, and documenting everything. In order to provide a solid foundation for future contributors, heavy AI assistance is used to keep documentation up to date and consistent. However all content is first thought out by a human, then formalized by AI and finally reviewed by a human once again.

:::note
The docs you're going to read might speak of yet unimplemented features or unenforced conventions. This is because Mosaic is a work in progress, and the documentation will evolve alongside the codebase. The goal is to provide a clear, consistent foundation that will guide both current and future contributors.
