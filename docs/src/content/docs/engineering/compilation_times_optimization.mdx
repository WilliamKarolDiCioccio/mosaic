title: Compilation time optimization
description: Strategies used in Mosaic to reduce C++ compilation times without sacrificing correctness or maintainability.
---

Compilation time is a first-class engineering concern in Mosaic. Slow builds disrupt iteration, discourage experimentation, and make refactoring costly. As the codebase grows, unmanaged dependencies quickly turn incremental changes into full rebuilds.

Mosaic addresses this problem by reducing header coupling, limiting transitive includes, and helping the compiler reuse work whenever possible. The strategies described here are mandatory guidelines for engine development and contributor code.

---

## Precompiled headers (PCH)

Mosaic uses **CMake precompiled headers** to reduce repeated parsing of large, frequently used headers. CMake injects these headers automatically through compiler options. You must not include them manually in source files.

```cmake
target_precompile_headers(
  mosaic
  PRIVATE
  <vector>
  <string>
  <iostream>
  <algorithm>
  <unordered_map>
  <unordered_set>
  <functional>
  <memory>
  <array>
  <chrono>
)
````

Precompiled headers are most effective when they contain headers that are:

* Expensive to parse
* Widely used across translation units
* Stable over time

### PCH usage rules

Follow these rules when modifying PCH contents:

* Include only **general-purpose** headers used broadly across the engine
* Avoid project-specific headers or implementation details
* Avoid headers that change frequently
* Prefer STL and platform headers with high parse cost

Poorly chosen PCH contents increase rebuild times instead of reducing them.

## Build-time analysis

Mosaic relies on **Visual Studio 2022 build analysis tools** to track compilation performance on Windows. These tools are used to identify:

* Excessive template instantiations
* Headers included transitively across many files
* Translation units with disproportionate compile cost

Use this data to guide refactoring. Optimization decisions must be driven by measured impact, not intuition.

When a file or header becomes a compile-time hotspot, address the dependency structure rather than adding workarounds.

## Reducing includes with opaque handles

Mosaic selectively uses **opaque handles** to reduce header dependencies in large or widely used APIs. This pattern replaces concrete type exposure with forward-declared, incomplete types.

This approach is especially useful in systems such as the renderer, where exposing full type definitions would otherwise force large transitive include chains.

### Tradeoffs

Opaque handles are not a free optimization.

**Benefits:**

* Reduced header coupling
* Faster incremental builds
* Cleaner public interfaces

**Costs:**

* Additional indirection
* Reduced type visibility
* Potential **ABI safety implications** if misused

Use opaque handles deliberately. Favor clarity and correctness over compile-time savings when the tradeoff is unclear.

## Planned improvements

Compilation time optimization is an ongoing effort. Planned improvements include:

* **Splitting the engine into multiple CMake targets**
  This allows subsystem-specific dependency graphs and tailored PCH sets.

* **Subsystem-scoped PCH usage**
  Each major subsystem will eventually define its own precompiled headers.

* **Evaluation of C++20 modules**
  Modules are not yet production-ready across all supported toolchains. Mosaic will adopt them only when support is stable and measurable benefits outweigh migration costs.

## Design principle

Compilation speed is a **structural property** of the codebase, not a post-hoc optimization. Clean boundaries, minimal headers, and explicit dependencies matter more than any individual tool or flag.

Every header you add today affects build times tomorrow.
