## 🌟 Feature Request – Mosaic Game Engine

### Pre-Request Checklist ✅

Before submitting this feature request, please confirm you've:

- [ ] Searched existing [issues](../../issues) to avoid duplicates 🔍
- [ ] Verified the feature aligns with Mosaic’s scope (engine-level, not app-specific) 📦
- [ ] Considered whether this feature would benefit multiple platforms or backends (e.g., Vulkan, WebGPU, etc.) 🌍

---

### 📋 Feature Summary

_A clear and concise description of the feature you are proposing._

**Example:** Add support for hot-reloading shaders during runtime for faster iteration and debugging.

---

### 🌠 Justification and Benefits

_Why is this feature valuable? How does it improve developer workflow or user experience?_

**Example:** Hot-reloading shaders would drastically reduce the feedback loop during graphics development and simplify visual debugging. It’s especially useful when working on materials or post-processing effects.

---

### 💡 Proposed Solution

_Describe how this feature could be implemented, ideally in terms of systems it would affect or leverage._

**Example:**

- Monitor shader file changes in the I/O thread.
- Add a `Shader::reload()` method that recompiles the shader and updates bound pipelines.
- Expose reload behavior via a dev UI toggle or keybinding in the runtime layer.

---

### 🔁 Alternatives Considered

_List any alternative ideas or design trade-offs you've explored._

**Example:**

- Implement a “reload all assets” command instead of targeting just shaders.
- Require an external scripting console to manually reload specific pipelines.

---

### 📂 Additional Context

_Add any sketches, diagrams, links, or related discussions that support your request._

**Example:**  
Link to a reference implementation in another engine, or screenshots of a typical debugging workflow this would support.

Thanks for helping shape the future of Mosaic! 💚
